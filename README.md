# Odin_Projects
HTML/CSS
My name is Patrick. I am a 58-year-old, first-year, self-guided student of coding, who has undertaken The Odin Project with a friend, who is also new to coding. I have created this Repo to host or house the first formal HTML/CSS project of the curriculum. I look forward to many opportunities to visit and work within this GitHub repo.
