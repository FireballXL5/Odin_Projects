# Odin_Projects
HTML/CSS
My name is Patrick. I am a 58-year-old, first-year, self-guided student of coding, who has undertaken The Odin Project with a friend, who is also new to coding. I have created this Repo to host or house the first formal HTML/CSS project of the curriculum. I look forward to many opportunities to visit and work within this GitHub repo.

My first exercise will be to add this commit, and create a new branch (whatever that is) and start a pull request (ditto). Ah, but I see, by investigating "Learn more about pull requests" that I need to fork my repo first, and that I've pushed the changes to my fork. Which I'll get to right away. Be right back ...
